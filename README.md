# JOCLSamples

Samples for JOCL - http://jocl.org

**Note:** These samples have been moved here from the original samples page
of the JOCL website, [http://www.jocl.org/samples/samples.html](http://www.jocl.org/samples/samples.html).
These are mainly *standalone* samples, which means that each class contains
the whole code that is required for the sample, although some of them refer
to kernels that are stored in `src/main/resources/kernels`. Several methods 
(e.g. for the basic OpenCL initialization) appear in each of these samples.
They may be moved to a utility class in the future.
